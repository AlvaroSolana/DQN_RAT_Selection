# DQN-RAT-Selection:  Improving User Throughput in Multi-RAT Networks Using Reinforcement Learning

## üì° Overview

With the exponential growth of connected mobile devices, the efficient use of wireless infrastructure has become increasingly important. Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection is a critical challenge in heterogeneous networks (HetNets), where users must choose efficiently between multiple available technologies, such as WiFi and LTE, in order to maximize their throughput.

The work was developed as part of a Bachelor's Thesis in Telecommunications Engineering, and it enables training, evaluation, and visualization of different metrics. For more information check the thesis report.

## üéØ Project Goal

To evaluate the effectiveness of DQN-based RAT-Selection compared to other baseline methods in different key metrics such as throughput, fairness,  managing congestion, and user disconnection rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in managing the complex and dynamic RAT selection problem.
